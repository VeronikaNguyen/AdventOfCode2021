There are 14 instruction blocks of the following form

inp w
mul x 0
add x z
mod x 26
div z d
add x a
eql x w
eql x 0
mul y 0
add y 25
mul y x
add y 1
mul z y
mul y 0
add y w
add y b
mul y x
add z y

where a, b, and d vary in each block (a, b are integers and d is either 1 or 26).
Consider z as a number in base 26.
Then each block is equivalent to the following instructions:

read current number and store into w
if the last digit of z + a does not equal w:
    z = 26 * z + w + b
    
if d equals 26:
    remove the last digit of z
    
a, b and d have the following values:

a:   14   15   12   11   -5   14   15  -13  -16   -8   15   -8    0   -4
b:   12    7    1    2    4   15   11    5    3    9    2    3    3   11
d:    1    1    1    1   26   1     1   26   26   26    1   26   26   26


This if-condition "if the last digit of z + a does not equal w" condition is met for 7 blocks. 
In order to reach zero for the remaining 7 blocks the if condition has to be not met. 
Thus, we obtain the following equations from the if-condition:

We denote the i-th input number by n_i:
n_5 = n_4 - 3
n_8 = n_7 - 2
n_9 = n_6 - 1
n_10 = n_3 - 7
n_12 = n_11 - 6
n_13 = n_2 + 7
n_14 = n_1 + 8

The rest is easy, we can choose n_i such that the the number n_1...n_14 is maximal/minimal.
